/*
Let α = a1 a2 ... an and β = b1 b2 ... bn be two strings with symbols taken
from the English alphabet (only lowercase). We say that α and β are anagrams if
α can be formed from β by rearranging the letters of β. For example, the English
words silent and listen are anagrams.

Describe an algorithm to determine whether α and β are anagrams in O(n log n)
time.

Can you design an algorithm that is faster than O(n log n)? Note: You may assume
that the English alphabet is totally ordered, i.e., a < b < · · · < z
